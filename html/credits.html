<h2>What is this book</h2>
<p>
    As a kid, I've always spent so much time reading magazines about videogames.
    I wanted here to recreate that experience for the arcade games I'm playing, starting with NeoGeo games.
    Today in 2020-ish we have a habit at home with my kids, we only change games once a month, unplug the Jammas or MVS carts and pick new ones.
    This makes us focus on 2-3 games only every months, enjoy those, before eventually swapping the month after.
    We have a little collection of NeoGeo games at home (30 of them), I wanted a little book showing all NeoGeo games, so that we can have a look in advance and pick our favorite on Day 1.
